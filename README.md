Created By Hammad Randhawa ©️

AI Approach:
The Tic-Tac-Toe game incorporates an AI approach through the implementation of the Minimax algorithm. 
The AI opponent intelligently analyzes the game state, exploring all possible moves and their outcomes to make optimal decisions. 
By leveraging this AI approach, players can experience engaging gameplay and face a formidable opponent capable of strategic moves.

Efficiency:
The game's code structure and algorithms are designed to ensure efficiency throughout the gameplay process.
The Minimax algorithm optimizes the AI opponent's decision-making process, resulting in challenging gameplay. 
The graphical user interface provides a smooth and responsive experience, allowing players to make moves effortlessly. 
Additionally, sound effects add an extra layer of immersion to the gameplay, enhancing the overall experience.
